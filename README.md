# Config Information
```
- The first field is check_flagged, if you would like the checker to check for flagged tokens then set it to true, if not then false
- The second field is offset_ms, this is how long it will wait between each token in milliseconds
```

# Ratelimit Information
```
- If you enable checking for flags and check a lot of tokens, there is the possibility of getting ratelimited
- To avoid ratelimits either don't check for flagged or increase the offset
```

# Other Information
```
- All token formats (token, email:pass:token, etc) are supported as long as the token is the longest part of it
- If you find any bugs with it make a pull request or an issue
- This tool is an educational POC tool to demonstrate how goroutines can be used to send requests 
```
